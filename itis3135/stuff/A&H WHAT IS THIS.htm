        Boy oh boy where do I even begin. Lebron‚Ä¶ honey, my pookie bear. I have loved you ever 
        since I first laid eyes on you. The way you drive into the paint and strike fear into 
        your enemies eyes. Your silky smooth touch around the rim, and that gorgeous jumpshot. 
        I would do anything for you. I wish it were possible to freeze time so I would never 
        have to watch you retire. You had a rough childhood, but you never gave up hope. You 
        are even amazing off the court, you're a great husband and father, sometimes I even 
        call you dad. I forvever dread and weep, thinking of the day you will one day retire. 
        I would sacrifice my own life it were the only thing that could put a smile on your 
        beautiful face. You have given me so much joy, and heartbreak over the years. 
        I remember when you first left clevenland and its like my heart got broken into a 
        million pieces. But a tear still fell from my right eye when I watched you win your 
        first ring in miami, because deep down, my glorious king deserved it. I just wanted 
        you to return home. Then allas, you did, my sweet baby boy came home and I rejoiced. 
        2015 was a hard year for us baby, but in 2016 you made history happen. You came back 
        from 3-1 and I couldn't believe it. I was crying, bawling even, and I heard my glorious 
        king exclaim these words, "CLEVELAND, THIS IS FOR YOU!" Not only have you changed the 
        game of basketball and the world forever, but you've eternally changed my world. And 
        now you're getting older, but still the goat, my goat. I love you pookie bear, my glorious king, 
        Lebron James. ü•∞‚ù§Ô∏èü´∂üèΩ (this is a copypasta lol)
