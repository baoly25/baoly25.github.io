                Boundless Lynx Park is a unique zoo dedicated entirely to felines, showcasing cats of all sizes, 
                from cute domestic breeds like British Shorthairs to wild predators like lions and of course lynxes.
                Visitors can explore exhibits featuring leopards, cheetahs, sphynxes, and a variety of other wild and domestic 
                felines. Visitors can interact with the domestic cats in a dedicated petting area where they can play with friendly 
                breeds like the Scottish Folds. This hands-on experience allows guests to connect with these cats up close while 
                learning about their behaviors, care, and unique characteristics. Educational signs will be displayed throughout 
                as visitors approach the animals and learn more about them. The park highlights the diversity of the feline family, 
                giving guests a chance to appreciate their unique behaviors, adaptations, and roles in nature.
