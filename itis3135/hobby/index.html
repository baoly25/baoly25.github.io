                strategic gameplay, and constant updates, it remains one of the most popular esports titles 
                in the world.

                I got into League of Legends in 2022 which was very late considering the game had been
                over 10 years old by then. I usually enjoy shooter games such as Valorant, Apex Legends, Fortnite, and Overwatch.
                Never would I have thought I would ever play League of Legends since the only time I tried it, I hated it. 
                This all changed in late 2022 when I decided to watch League of Legends Worlds 2022 which had a lot of coverage 
                during that time. This was when I discovered the team DRX and a player named Deft. I enjoyed their underdog 
                story and was inspired to play. From this point on I started to play League of Legends in the role of ADC like my 
                favorite player Deft. 
            </p>

            <h3>Other games I enjoy and my favorite character to play in each: </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Overwatch - Sojourn and Tracer</li>
                <li>Valorant - Jett and Sova</li>
                <li>Apex Legends - Revenant</li>
                <li>Plants Vs Zombies</li>
                <li>Bloons TD 5 & 6</li>

            <h2>Best Times</h2>

            <p>
                You can play League of Legends any time of the day. Pick a time that is right for you and 
                hop into the rift! My favorite time to play games is when I am finished with all my 
                responsibilities for that day. As a result, my playing time is usually later in the day. 
                I also enjoy watching League of Legends Esports which runs throughout most of the year. 
            </p>

            <h3>Best Time to Watch Esports</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring & Summer Splits:</strong> Regional leagues (LCK, LPL, LEC, LTA) run from January to August.</li>

                <li><strong>World Championship (Worlds):</strong> The biggest event, held in October - November.</li>

                Like any other video game, you can play League of Legends from anywhere.
                It is not a hard game to run so an old computer can still play it just fine. 
                You can play on your laptop or personal computer at home. Some people opt to play 
                at internet cafes or PC bangs that are popular in Asia. These are places that offer 
                PC to play games on for a small hourly fee.

            <p>
                League of Legends is a hard game to pick up as I disliked it the first time I played it.
                It was different from the shooter games I came from, but it quickly grew on me. My only suggestion
                is to keep playing the game to improve. Like anything in life, you can only get better by practicing more.
            </p>

            <h3>Other Ways to Improve</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Watch YouTube Guides</li>
                <li>Watch streamers play the game</li>
                <li>Watch League of Legends Esports</li>

                League of Legends isn't just a game, it's a story of resilience, skill, and unforgettable moments. 
                Esports has turned LoL into a worldwide phenomenon, with players and teams writing their legacies 
                on the biggest stage. One of the most inspiring stories was DRX's 2022 Worlds run, where Deft, after a 
                decade of struggle, led his team from Play-Ins to a miraculous victory. They took down tournament favorites 
                like Gen.G and T1, proving that heart and perseverance can defy all odds.
