                        “Nestled in downtown Concord, this quaint little spot provided a 
                        amazing atmosphere for my family and I to enjoy quick bite to eat. 
                        This place has just opened in December and we've been wanting to try it out. 
                        Everything we ordered was delicious and well presented from the pho to the rice plates. 
                        The staff were amazing!!! My family and I wanted to personally thank the cook Abraham and 
                        the cashier ( I forgot her name, but she looked like Zoe Saldana). They were so warm and 
                        welcoming. It felt as if we've known them for ages! We highly recommend this place and 
                        will return VERY soon. 10/10”

                        “After venturing downtown Concord and hitting up the basement, the three of us stopped in 
                        for a quick dinner before heading home. The inside was nice and clean and the staff was very 
                        friendly. A decent sized menu with traditional offerings. We ordered about 4 orders of the rice 
                        paper rollsz definitely worth it. Peanut sauce was traditional, and well put together. The rolls 
                        were fresh, packed nicely, and rolled tight. The traditional Phō was great! Brother was deep in flavor, 
                        rich and greatly appreciated on the cold night. The Brisket and Round eye were tender, and adding the 
                        sweet Thai basil was just the perfect touch! The Hibachi style steak was also good but a little underwhelming. 
                        Best to stick to the Phō!”

                        and the food itself was fricken awesome. Some of the best hibachi I've ever had at half the price. 
                        Would highly recommend to anyone who appreciates good hibachi and good pho.”

                        and steak as well as the teriyaki chicken with broccoli and noodles. Both were cooked perfectly 
                        and full of flavor. I'm definitely coming back to try more! Highly recommend!”

                        “Me personally, I hardly ever leave reviews, but after eating at this restaurant I had 
                        to write about my absolute stellar experience that I've had the last 3 visits. The Pho 
                        is incredible, on par with some of the best I've had. This goes as well for their hibachi. 
                        I highly recommend coming here and trying it, you won't be disappointed. It's one of my new 
                        favorites and you can consider me a regular from now on.”

                        “I had the pleasure of ordering takeout at this newly opened Japanese/Asian fusion restaurant, 
                        and it was an outstanding experience from start to finish! Upon entering, we were immediately 
                        greeted with warm smiles, setting the tone for a welcoming atmosphere. The service was incredibly 
                        efficient, with our food arriving quickly after ordering, which was a pleasant surprise.

                        The highlight of the meal was the hibachi chicken and steak - cooked to perfection with incredible 
                        flavor and tenderness. The seasoning was just right, and the portion sizes were generous. It's clear 
                        that the chefs take great pride in their craft. The entire meal was a delightful fusion of flavors that 
                        left us eager to return for more.
                        
                        The ambiance was modern yet cozy, making it a great spot for both casual dinners and special occasions. 
                        The staff was attentive and friendly, adding to the overall positive experience. I highly recommend this 
                        restaurant to anyone in the area-whether you're a fan of Japanese cuisine or just love great food, you won't 
                        be disappointed! We can't wait to come back and try more dishes.”
