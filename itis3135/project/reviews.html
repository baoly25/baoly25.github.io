                        “Nestled in downtown Concord, this quaint little spot provided a 
                        amazing atmosphere for my family and I to enjoy quick bite to eat. 
                        This place has just opened in December and we've been wanting to try it out. 
                        Everything we ordered was delicious and well presented from the pho to the rice plates. 
                        The staff were amazing!!! My family and I wanted to personally thank the cook Abraham and 
                        the cashier ( I forgot her name, but she looked like Zoe Saldana). They were so warm and 
                        welcoming. It felt as if we've known them for ages! We highly recommend this place and 
                        will return VERY soon. 10/10”

                        “After venturing downtown Concord and hitting up the basement, the three of us stopped in 
                        for a quick dinner before heading home. The inside was nice and clean and the staff was very 
                        friendly. A decent sized menu with traditional offerings. We ordered about 4 orders of the rice 
                        paper rollsz definitely worth it. Peanut sauce was traditional, and well put together. The rolls 
                        were fresh, packed nicely, and rolled tight. The traditional Phō was great! Brother was deep in flavor, 
                        rich and greatly appreciated on the cold night. The Brisket and Round eye were tender, and adding the 
                        sweet Thai basil was just the perfect touch! The Hibachi style steak was also good but a little underwhelming. 
                        Best to stick to the Phō!”

                        and the food itself was fricken awesome. Some of the best hibachi I've ever had at half the price. 
                        Would highly recommend to anyone who appreciates good hibachi and good pho.”
