                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Submission & Files:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Project link works and it can be found in the the nav bar of the course homepage.</li>
                            <li>I found no upper case and spaces in all file names and image names which was good.</li>
                            <li>All files are orgainized correctly in the right places.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Design:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Color choices are easy to see and visually pleasing. I see no places where there are poor contrast.</li>
                            <li><strong>Repitition:</strong> Each page has consistent styling in terms color, font style, font size, nav bar, and buttons. I do not see anything concerning.</li>
                            <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Everything is aligned and formatted in their respective area. Great job here!</li>
                            <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Spacing could be improve as I notice a lot of white space that could be used to put more content. This might be because this is not the final version and you are still adding more content later on. I also suggest reducing the  size of your footer as it is way too large relative to the content in there.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Page Elements:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Every page has a header, main, footer, and nav bar.</li>
                            <li>There is no tagline although one is not needed in this context.</li>
                            <li>Each components are placed in its correct h tag.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Assignment Requirements:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Entry/Home Page has all appropriate content and layout.</li>
                            <li>Navigational Bar contains all mandatory pages.</li>
                            <li>There are 3 Product/Service Pages with each containing images.</li>
                            <li>URL work correctly.</li>
                            <li>I find that there is enough comments on each file where it is necessary. The amount of comments may be seem as lacking for others due to the lack of comments on some pages. I believe you have enough comments since not every file need an explanation because they are simple.</li>
                            <li>Site is visually pleasing and easy to navigate.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Additional Comments & Feedback</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I like your project and I find that it is visually pleasing. I see the vision you are going with and if you continue adding more content, it would be nice!</li>
                            <li>I notice that the logo uses serif for the name while you used sans serif for your h1. I think matching the fonts of the logo and your h1 would be nice. This is a minor detail which does not impact much but I thought this small change could be good.</li>
                            <li>Overall, great start on the project. Continue adding to it and finishing up the design and it will be great!</li>
