                            easy to read. The green of the game's logo stand out from the blue skies which 
                            creates balance and a nice aesthetic. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Repetition:</strong> Font style and colors are consistent throughout the website

                <h3>Bad Website - <a href="https://web.mit.edu/vrtour/index.html" target="_blank">MIT Virtual Tour</a></h3>
                <p>
                    The MIT Virtual Tour website lacks design, outdated, and overall very dull. It looks like what would happen when you 
                    turn off CSS on a website. This website offer a virtual tour of the campus however, it only provides only 
                    low quality images. This feel like a forgotten website or it is intentionally like this.
                </p>
                <div class="bullet-list">
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Contrast:</strong> Uses a white background with black text and blue links for most 
                            of the content. Buttons for the virtual tour can be difficult to navigate as they are blurry and 
                            contrast is not clear. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Repetition:</strong> Inconsistent font and different layout between some pages.
                        </li>
                        <li>    
                            <strong>Alignment:</strong> Elements are not properly aligned, with text and images sometimes 
                            appearing misplaced. Lacks a clear grid structure to the page.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Proximity:</strong> Content is poorly placed with the nav bar being at the bottom. Spacing 
                            is uneven with some places having too much and others too little. Overall, the flow of the content does 
                            not logically flow which might confuse users. 
                        </li>
