                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Submission & Files:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>There was no link in your course page's nav bar for me to get to the project. I had to go through your github files to find the folder name and searched it manually. Outside of needing to add your project link to the course page's nav bar, the link was functional.</li>
                            <li>I found no upper case and spaces in all file names and image names which was good.</li>
                            <li>All files are orgainized correctly in the right places.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Design:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> I like the color theme you chose as they are not interfering with one another. Everything contrasted well on all your pages.</li>
                            <li><strong>Repitition:</strong> Font style, color, and formatting was consistent throughout all your pages.</li>
                            <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Everythig is properly aligned and was visually appealing.</li>
                            <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Spacing was good on some pages but I noticed the gallery page had some white space that could be used. I would suggest putting the shirts evenly so like in 4x2 rather than having a row of 6 and a row of 2. You might not be finished with the CSS however, I find that you could space out the FAQ section more since I feel like it might be too cluttered. Same for the customs page.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Page Elements:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Every page has a header, main, footer, and nav bar.</li>
                            <li>Tagline was present and made sense.</li>
                            <li>Each components are placed in its correct h tag.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Assignment Requirements:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Your homepage contain all the required items.</li>
                            <li>Navigational Bar is present and contained all necessary pages.</li>
                            <li>There are 3 Product/Service Pages with each containing images.</li>
                            <li>URL work correctly.</li>
                            <li>There are not enough comments on every file.</li>
                            <li>Site was nice to look at, I like the small animation you added when users hovered over the images.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                        <strong>Additional Comments & Feedback</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>From first impressions, your project look very nice. It was professional and looked functional. It reminds me of professionally made websites that large coporations have.</li>
                            <li>I like the small details you added such as the sliding animation of the images for when users first arrive to the page. I like the animation for when users hover over the shirts, I think it really makes them pop.</li>
                            <li>I think the search bar at the top might be for aesthetic purposes but I am not sure what that is for.</li>
                            <li>I noticed that when I clicked on the shirts in the gallery page, it shows up a small horizontal bar. I am not sure if that was intended but it would be better if a larger image of the shirt appears when users click on it </li>
                            <li>I also think more CSS can be added to the FAQ and customs page so that it could look better.</li>
                            <li>There is a lot of warnings that appears in Accumlus on the homepage, I think fixing those could be good.</li>
                            <li>I also notice Accumlus is not added to all pages of your site.</li>
                            <li>When users view their cart with a item in it, the image of the item does not appear. Although this is minor, I think fixing this would be good.</li>
                            <li>Overall, I really like your project, it was nice navigate around. I think you just need to finish up fixing the Accumlus errors and adding some more CSS and it will be completed.</li>
